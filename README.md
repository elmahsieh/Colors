### Project Information
This project utilizes the supplied data file “data.json” added to the assets folder. The project includes breaking points to validate the data model is being used accurately. The primary interface of this project is a scrollable list that showcases each color item with its corresponding color as the background, with the color’s name and hex string displayed in the individual color cells. Once the user taps on a color cell, that color’s detail screen shows up, including further information such as its name, RGB, HSL, ColorID, and hex string. The background color of the detail screen is the color selected. A white hue/shadow is around the texts to make the words more readable, especially with the text being black and some backgrounds are darker. The detail screen also includes a back button to return to the initial screen.
